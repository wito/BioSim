 *
 *  @section intro_sec Compilation and installation
 *
 *  To build and install, in a terminal execute:
 *  @code
 *  # make
 *  # sudo make install
 *  @endcode
 *  This will install BioSim in /usr/bin/BioSim and the BioSim documentation in HTML format in /usr/share/doc/BioSim/. Building the program requires @c libpng and development files, available through package @c libpng-dev.
 *  @see prefix.h
 *  @section usage_sec Usage
 *  Synopsis:
 *  @code
 *  # BioSim filename [filename...]
 *  @endcode
 *  Any number of filenames may be entered on the command line. Where several filenames are entered, the simulations will be run in the order they are specified.
 *  @section infile_formats Input File Formats
 *  @subsection sim_file .sim File
 *  The .sim file contains simulation parameters.
 *  The BioSim Extended sim format differs from the BioSim Standard format in the following manner:
 *    - All parameters are @b formally optional, exepting the following
 *      - @c Geografi
 *      - @c StartAar
 *      - @c SluttAar
 *      - @c Populasjon
 *      - @c UtdataStamme
 *    - The following keywords are added:
 *      - @c DumpPNGInterval
 *      - @c CelleSpec
 *      - @c ArtParameter
 *    - While they are formally optional, a .sim file must have:
 *      - At least one @c ArtParameter, @c RovdyrParameter or @c BytteParameter. A file can have any number of @c ArtParameter, but only one each of @c RovdyrParameter and @c BytteParameter.
 *      - @b Either a @c CelleSpec @b or a @c CelleParameter.
 *    - While they are entirely optional, a .sim file should (probably) have:
 *      - @c SlumptallFroe
 *      - At least one @c DumpXXXInterval. If none are given, no reports are written exept the .dat report.
 *  @subsection par_files .par Files
 *  The .par files contains parameters for animal species and map cells.
 *  @subsection spec_files .spec Files
 *  The .spec files contains detailed information on map cells; using .spec files, any number of cell types can be defined, each with separate alpha and F<sub>max</sub> values as desired. It should be noted that
 *  this mechanism assumes that savannah and jungle formul√¶ converge at alpha = 1.0.
 *  The internal format is simple;
 *  @code
 *  #name alpha fmax live colour
 *      H   0.0    0    0 0000ff
 *      S   0.3  100    1 a0ffa0
 *      J   1.0  550    1 008000
 *      F   0.0    0    0 666666
 *      O   0.0    0    1 ffd700
 *  @endcode
 *  @c name is a single character; @c alpha is a floating point value in range [0.0,1.0]; @c fmax is F<sub>max</sub>, @c live is the simulation status: live cells are part of the simulation, dead cells are not.
 *  @c live is expressed as @c 0 or @c 1 (false or true). @c colour is the colour to use for rendering the cell type as a 3-byte RGB triplet, using upper or lower case a through f.
 *  This mode supports an arbitrary number of cell types; but in the current implementation the number of cell types is limited by the number of available printable characters in the current code page (usually about 200).
 *  Using characters outside [a-zA-Z0-9] is not really reccomended.
 *  @subsection geo_file .geo File
 *  The .geo file contains map data for the simulation.
 *  @subsection pop_file .pop File
 *  The .pop files contains data for presimulated populations to use in the simulation.
 *  @note This version of BioSim uses '#' (hash) as the default comment character in all files, and not '%%'. This allows for the #! construct.
 *  @section outfile_formats Output File Formats
 *  @subsection dat_files .dat Files
 *  The .dat file is the principal output format.
 *  @subsection for_files .for Files
 *  The .for files contain information about feed distribution over the Simulation map.
 *  @subsection pop_files .pop Files
 *  The .pop files contain detailed information about the population distribution over the Simulation map.
 *  @subsection dyr_files .dyr Files
 *  The .dyr files contain generic information about the population distribution over the Simulation map.
